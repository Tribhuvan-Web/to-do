Session vs Request scopes

-> All Request from browser are handled by our web application deployed on a server
-> Request Scope => Active for a single Request only 
                    -> Once the respone is sent back the Request attributes will be removed from the memory
                    -> These cannot be used for future Request
                    -> Recommended for most use cases
-> Session Scope => Details are stored accross multiple Request
                    -> Be careful about what you store in session (Takes additional memory as all details are stored in the server)
                    
Validation with Spring Boot

1 -> Spring boot starter Validation 
        -> pom.xml
2 -> Command Bean (Form Backing Object) 
        -> 2 way (todo.jsp & TodoController.java)
3 -> Add Validation to the Bean
         -> Todo.java
4 -> Display Validation Error in the view       
        -> todo.jsp
